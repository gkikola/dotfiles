# Greg Kikola's dotfiles

My personal configuration files that I use on my systems which run various
GNU/Linux distributions.


# Usage

These files can be easily managed with
[GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

The files are grouped into subdirectories. To install a particular group of
files, navigate to the base directory (the one containing this README.md
file) and run the command `stow DIRECTORY`, where `DIRECTORY` is the
subdirectory containing the files to be installed. This will create
symbolic links within your home directory that point to the files in this
git repository.
